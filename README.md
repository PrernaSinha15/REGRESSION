Overview
This repository contains a regression model implemented in Python for predicting concrete strength based on the properties of the concrete mix. The model is trained on the well-known Concrete Compressive Strength dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Concrete Compressive Strength dataset, which contains 1030 instances and 9 attributes describing the components used in creating the concrete mix and the compressive strength of the resulting concrete cylinders.

Model
The regression model implemented in this repository uses [Linear Regression] for training and prediction. It takes into account various features from the dataset to predict the compressive strength of concrete.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)
